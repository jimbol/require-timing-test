But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space.  I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet.

Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me.

Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders.

When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space.  I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral.

You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers?

I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing?

Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space.  I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules.

I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal.

Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere!

I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore.

We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise.

Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice.

This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos?

That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress.

But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans.

Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise.

When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice.

This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos?

That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress.

But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans.

Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise.

When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice.

This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos?

That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress.

But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans.

Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise.

When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice.

This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos?

That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress.

But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space.I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans.

Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise.

When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice.

This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos?

That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress.

But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans.

Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space.  I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise.

When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice.

This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos?

That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress.

But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans.

Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise.

When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice.

This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos?

That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress.

But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans.

Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise.

When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice.

This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos?

That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress.

But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans.

Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise.

When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice.

This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos?

That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress.

But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans.

Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise.

When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice.

This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? This should be interesting. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos?

That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. What? We're not at all alike! and attack the Romulans. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We have a saboteur aboard. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. You enjoyed that. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Computer, belay that order. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. How long can two people talk about nothing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Your shields were failing, sir. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. They were just sucked into space."
